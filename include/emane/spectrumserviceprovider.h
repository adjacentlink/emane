/**
 * @page SpectrumService Spectrum Service
 *
 * The @ref EMANE::SpectrumServiceProvider "Spectrum Service" provides NEM component layers with
 * access to the spectrum monitoring capabilities of the @ref EMANE::FrameworkPHY "emulator's physical layer".
 *
 * Each emulator physical layer instance can be configured to monitor a frequency of interest set. A
 * @ref EMANE::NoiseRecorder "noise recorder" is instantiated for each frequency of interest. The noise
 * recorder keeps track of signal energy and can be queried at a specified time for a @ref EMANE::SpectrumWindow
 * "spectrum window". A spectrum window contains binned signal energies across a requested duration along with
 * the information necessary to interpret the data.
 *
 * Each over-the-air  message is checked for frequency overlap using the transmitter and receiver
 * bandwidth. If there is an overlap, a proportional amount of signal energy is applied.
 *
 * There are three types of noise recording modes:
 * - none
 * - out-of-band
 * - all
 *
 * Noise recording mode @a none does not record any signal energy and will always return 0 mW bins
 * whenever queried.
 *
 * Noise recording mode @a out-of-band will only record signal energy for out-of-band messages. An
 * out-of-band message is one that does not match the physical layer subid or a message that matches the
 * subid but contains one or more frequency segments with a frequency that is not in the configured
 * frequency of interest set.
 *
 * Noise recording mode @a all will record all signal energy including in-band signals. This will require
 * subtracting the in-band signal energy in order to determine the noise.
 *
 * @section NoiseRecording Noise Recording
 *
 * Spectrum energy is recorded on a @ref EMANE::Wheel "wheel of bins". Bin width in microseconds can be
 * configured as part of the @ref EMANE::FrameworkPHY "emulator's physical layer" configuration. When an
 * over-the-air message is received, the receive power is calculated based on the configured propagation
 * model and antenna gain profiles. If the receive power is above the receiver sensitivity, it is applied
 * to one or more wheel bins based on the signal duration.
 *
 * Signal energy is applied at the start-of-reception time which is the: start-of-transmission +
 * propagation + first frequency segment offset. The emulator's physical layer is configured with the
 * maximum allowable message duration, propagation time and frequency segment offset. By default, messages
 * sent containing values above the configured maximums will be dropped.
 *
 * @section SpectrumWindow Interpreting a Spectrum Window
 *
 * An NEM component layer can query for a spectrum window by specifying a frequency, start time and duration.
 * The frequency must be in the configured frequency of interest set and the start time cannot be earlier
 * than @a now - max duration or later than @a now.
 *
 * The EMANE::SpectrumServiceProvider::request method is used to request a spectrum window. The following
 * example is taken from the @ref  models/mac/rfpipe/maclayer.cc "RF Pipe MAC layer" implementation and
 * shows a spectrum window request and noise floor determination using the EMANE::Utils::maxBinNoiseFloor
 * utility function.
 *
 * @snippet models/mac/rfpipe/maclayer.cc spectrumservice-request-snibbet
 *
 * You must wait for the end-of-reception time prior to requesting a spectrum window in order to account for
 * all the signal energy that occurs during the message duration, where end-of-reception =
 * start-of-reception + message duration.
 *
 * The emulator's physical layer will pass along an EMANE::Controls::ReceivePropertiesControlMessage and an
 * EMANE::Controls::FrequencyControlMessage with each upstream packet.
 *
 * The EMANE::Controls::ReceivePropertiesControlMessage contains the message start-of-transmission time, the
 * message propagation delay, the message span and the receiver sensitivity. The message span is the total
 * time between the start of the signal's earliest frequency segment and the end of the signal's latest
 * frequency segment. The span is supplied to make spectrum window querying easier.

 * It is best practice to always use the span when requesting a spectrum window even if you are only interested
 * in one or more smaller subsets of the window.  This will allow you to analyze a single window for one or more
 * subsets without making additional requests to the spectrum service.
 *
 * For messages with one or more frequencies, a spectrum window should be requested for each of the frequencies.
 *
 * The EMANE::SpectrumWindow contains:
 * - Vector of binned signal energies in mW
 * - The time of the first bin
 * - The bin duration in microseconds
 * - The receiver sensativity in dBm
 * - A flag indicating whether the in-band signal energy is contained in the bins
 *
 * The EMANE::Utils::maxBinNoiseFloor utility function will use the maximum binned signal energy in a spectrum
 * window (or subset of a spectrum window) as the noise floor. If the in-band signal is contained in the binned value
 * it will be removed and if no additional energy is present in the bin, the receiver sensitivity will be used as the
 * noise floor.
