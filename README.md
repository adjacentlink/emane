EMANE (Extendable Mobile Ad-hoc Network Emulator) is an open source framework 
which provides wireless network experimenters with a highly flexible modular 
environment for use during the design, development and testing of simple and 
complex network architectures. EMANE uses a physical layer model to account for 
signal propagation, antenna profile effects and interference sources in order 
to provide a realistic environment for wireless experimentation. Individual 
radio model plugins are used to emulate the lowest layers of a waveform and can 
be combined with existing Software Defined Radio (SDR) implementations to 
enable shared code emulation.
